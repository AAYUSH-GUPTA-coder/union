Union's Ceremony has the following components:

- Web app [ceremony.union.build](https://ceremony.union.build)
- [MPC client](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/pkgs/container/union%2Fmpc-client), running in the terminal 
- The coordinator, managing the queue and aggregating uploads.

We use [Nix](https://nixos.org) to create fully reproducible builds of all components and provide commands so that you can build them yourself.

## Web App

Deployed on [ceremony.union.build](https://ceremony.union.build), Handles auth and shows queue status. Also shows all contributions.

You can build it locally like this:

```sh
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=true nix build github:unionlabs/union/release/ceremony#ceremony
```

## MPC Client

Image published [here](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/pkgs/container/union%2Fmpc-client), handles the generation of the contribution, generation of the gpg key, and signs/uploads the contributions.

You can build it locally like this:

```sh
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=true nix build github:unionlabs/union/bbfaa2f39d0183c2fd6c1d2505fad6c64ddb39e1#packages.x86_64-linux.mpc-client -L
```

and load the image like this:

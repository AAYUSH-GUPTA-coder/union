Today, Union's public testnet goes live, marking a significant milestone in modular interoperability.
The modular stack is getting unified, and now you can be part of it.
To access the testnet, go to [app.union.build](https://app.union.build),
connect your wallet ([MetaMask](https://metamask.io), [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app), and [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io) supported),
and start transferring assets. The Union public testnet is a first step in the tiered rollout of Union‚Äôs Testnet. 
Expect many partners and chains to be onboarded in the next few weeks. [Try it now](https://app.union.build).

## What this Means

With the Union testnet live, users have the opportunity to be at the forefront of modular interoperability,
and test the Union network ahead of its mainnet launch. The testnet features an integrated faucet,
making it easy for users to obtain testnet tokens and engage with the platform.
Transferring assets will be available between the Union testnet and the Ethereum Sepolia testnet to start,
with more testnet chains added soon.

### Key Actions Users Can Take on Testnet

- Go to [app.union.build](https://app.union.build)
- Connect your wallets ([MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/), [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/), more coming soon)
- Get testnet UNO tokens from the [Union Faucet](https://app.union.build/faucet)
- Transfer UNO from Union testnet to Sepolia with the [Transfer function](https://app.union.build/transfer)
- Explore Union data on the [Explorer](https://app.union.build/explorer)
- _Bonus_: Transfer UNO from Ethereum Sepolia back to Union testnet. Use the [QuickNode Sepolia Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia) to get Sepolia ETH.
- Be ready for future missions. Follow [@union_build]( https://x.com/union_build) and [@0xkaiserkarel](https://x.com/0xkaiserkarel) for updates.

By participating in the testnet, users battle-test the network,
such as by helping to verify that Union's ZK circuits operate successfully in production environments for many users.
This helps to ensure the network's robustness and reliability ahead of the mainnet launch.

Community feedback and engagement are invaluable in shaping the future of Union and achieving our mission of modular interoperability.

## Unifying the Modular Stack with ZK-powered Interoperability

Union's mission is to connect every blockchain across the modular multi-chain landscape.
It aims to do so in a secure, decentralized, and cost-efficient manner using ZK-powered consensus verification.

The launch of the public testnet is a big leap forward in realizing Union's vision of creating a sovereign interoperability layer
that is permissionlessly accessible to every L1, appchain, rollup, and the thousands of blockchains yet to be created.

As Union co-founder Karel notes:

*‚ÄúOur public testnet represents not just a technical milestone for our team, but a way for users to start participating in the Union.
We are rolling out new features rapidly in the UI, including new networks,
faster proving times, and support for L2s and L3s. We aim to eliminate the barriers between otherwise isolated blockchain ecosystems,
as well as foster innovation through permissionless composability, which is a key requirement for scaling a modular,
multi-chain world. We ask ourselves, how do we enable the next ten thousand builders to choose modular and integrated solutions.‚Äù*

Union enables fully permissionless composability across ecosystem borders and for any application.
This gives rise to a world of fast, application-specific blockchains and rollups.

No more need to wait for centralized entities to choose to support a network. No more multi-sigs. No more bridge hacks.

Just Union.

Across the entire modular stack.

The upcoming launch of Berachain's high-performance, EVM-compatible blockchain marks a significant milestone in DeFi.
At the heart of Berachain's innovative Proof-of-Liquidity consensus are the principles of fairness, transparency, and accessibility.
We envision a future where DeFi is accessible to the 99%, with Berachain playing a crucial role in making this vision a reality.

To support protocols like Berachain and build a more integrated DeFi, it is essential to get rid of the existing silos.
Union's trustless zero-knowledge infrastructure will serve as the modular interoperability solution for all general message passing and asset transfers,
thereby reducing liquidity fragmentation.
With Union, more users will enjoy the DeFi primitives built on Berachain without sacrificing security or speed.

By joining forces, Union has also agreed to become an official launch partner with Berachain to use it as a primary liquidity hub.
Both parties will collaborate to boost each other's brand, enhancing mutual growth and visibility in the lead-up to our respective mainnet launches.

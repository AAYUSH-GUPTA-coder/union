                        <p>Union is a modular interoperability protocol which facilitates the exchange of

                        <p>Union’s key innovation is in combining consensus verification, where validators

                        <p>Modularity in crypto refers to the design principle where a blockchain system is

                            <p>Think of Union as a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) network where the state of each
                                chain resides.
                                When a new blockchain integrates with Union, it gets a Union light client that verifies
                                mathematically secure ZKPs generated from the counterparty chains.</p>
                            <p>Anytime a user sends a transaction from Chain A to Chain B, a ZKP is generated
                                on Chain A
                                through one of the proving markets supported by Union, or directly on bare-metal
                                hardware.
                                The prover then submits the ZKP to Chain B, where an on-chain verifier—a smart contract
                                or
                                L2 module—confirms the Merkle inclusion proof that Chain A sent the message. Once the
                                ZKP is
                                verified, all transactions up to that ZKP are immediately settled, allowing the prover
                                to
                                settle large batches of transactions.</p>
                            <p>Within the light client on Chain B, consensus verification is used to show that
                                the
                                validators of Chain A signed the Merkle root. In zero-knowledge based IBC, this
                                consensus
                                verification is achieved by verifying a ZKP of consensus on-chain. Provers generate ZKPs
                                of
                                consensus by confirming that the validators signed a block’s Merkle root within a
                                zero-knowledge circuit.</p>
                            <p>What is great about this system is that anyone can generate a ZKP of consensus
                                on
                                consumer-grade hardware, eliminating censorship risk. There are no trust assumptions on
                                the
                                prover, nor centralized components like an oracle or multisig. Even if Union ceased to
                                exist, the outlined transaction flow would continue permissionlessly into eternity.</p>

                            <p>State verification between blockchains is often gas-intensive due to the
                                complexity of
                                verifying consensus on other chains with varied structures and execution environments.
                                This is why, in the past, many ecosystems turned to trusted third parties such as
                                single-signature, multisig, and MPC bridges for interoperability.</p>
                            <p>With Union, trusted third parties are no longer necessary. Consensus
                                verification unlocks
                                trust-minimized interoperability between blockchains, and zero-knowledge cryptography
                                makes the process scalable and cost-efficient fast. Union extends the gold standard of
                                the <span class="text-accent-500">Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)</span>
                                to all of web3 with ZK-powered consensus verification, unlocking trustless communication
                                between blockchains.</p>
                            <p>The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) functions similarly to
                                TCP/IP, and
                                facilitates communication between independent blockchains. Blockchains that support IBC
                                can establish connections with other IBC chains, allowing one blockchain to verify
                                proofs against the consensus state of another using a light client. This enables robust
                                interoperability among IBC-compatible blockchains, including asset transfers, atomic
                                swaps, cross-chain decentralized exchanges, and even cross-chain smart contracts. IBC
                                has been lately gaining widespread adoption, making it a promising candidate as the
                                governing interoperability standard of Web3.</p>

                        <p>We've built Galois around three fundamental principles: fast execution,
                            low-cost operation, and decentralization. The architecture involves three key steps for

                            Proof (ZKP) of the Union state, and updating the counterparty with the Union state,
                            which promotes accessibility for all participants in the system.</p>
                        <p>Galois can outperform other zero-knowledge bridges while operating on a
